			<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<h3></h3>
				<p> In every sport, there are plenty of common injuries that many players deal with. However, there is no injury more well known in a sport than Tommy John Surgery is in baseball. 

				<p> This surgery usually requires the complete reconstruction of the Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) which usually stems from elbow issues. The UCL is the ligament on the inside of the elbow, and it tears when there’s too much stress put on it. The injury stems from pitchers who throw thousands of pitches at speeds anywhere from 75 to 100 miles per hour for years on end.

			<p> he name Tommy John comes from the first person to receive the surgery back in 1974. Since then, the surgery is seen as a very commonnolaity especially for pitchers.

			<p>With the increased velocity of pitchers, one might think there should be a steady rise in cases. However, that's not the case. In the past couple of years cases have somewhat been decreasing. It's shocking to see this because on top of the fact that players are throwing harder there are new rules implemented against pitchers leaguwide. 

			<p>Just last season in 2023, the MLB introduced the pitch clock to speed up the games, specifically pitchers. Instead of having unlimited time to deliver a pitch, pitchers now have 20 seconds in between each pitch to deliver another one. This completly changed how pitchers approach each at bat, causing them to feel rushed, leading them to overthrow the ball. 

			<p> Despite this, players always adjust, and the same goes for the crackdown on sticky substances. Many pitchers were able to get away with putting illegal substances on the baseball to help make it easier to grip. Just two years ago, the MLB implemented a new policy to have umpires check the hands, glove, and hat of each pitcher that comes in and out of the game. 
				
			<p>Using these sticky substances makes it so pitchers don’t have to grip the ball as hard, and when that rule went away, many got injured. These players now had to bear down on the ball almost twice as hard without the sticky substances. </p>

					<h3>Tommy John Surgery List</h3> 
				 <p>  Back in 2012, Jon Roegele, a Major League Baseball writer began collecting a list of any baseball player from high school all the way up to MLB who underwent Tommy John Surgery. Despite starting in 2012, Roegel still has countless data from players who underwent the procedure before that year. 

				
 		<p>Today, the list has over 2400 different Tommy John cases and is updated any time Roegele receives information about any surgeries. Due to some teams not disclosing key information on their players getting Tommy John, it sometimes makes it hard for Roegele to add to the list. On top of that, it’s difficult to find high schoolers and even college players who have undergone the procedure, especially if they are not top prospects. 
		
 		<p>Kurt Rivera is a Clinical Research Coordinator at Digestive Healthcare of Georgia and despite not being a Tommy John specialist, Rivera has been around baseball his whole life.  He’s worked as a youth pitching coach on the side, allowing him to see how the surgery was affecting young players. 

		<p>He too was a little shocked that there was actually a slight decline in both Tommy John cases and the average recovery time for each player. 

		<p>“The new arm brace that Bryce Harper used is something that will definitly change the game,” Rivera said. “Just look how fast he got back to playing.” 

		<p>Harper has been in the league for 13 years and primarily plays right field, but underwent the internal brace repair in November of 2022. In just 182 days, Harper was back on the field playing, despite not playing in the outfield due to the long throws that he had to occasionally make.
				
		<p>Even though Harper is not a pitcher, it was almost unheard of to see a player return to baseball in less than six months. The veteran was seen wearing a brace over top of his jersey which is different from the internal brace, but the two work hand in hand to get players back faster. 
			
		<p>Although this was seen as extremely risky, Harper might have just set a trend for what lengths, — at least position players — will go to get back on the diamond faster. Not even two years later, Harper is almost completely healed despite still playing in the infield which is now his primary spot. This is not because he can’t make the long throws anymore, but more so that he doesn’t have to if his other teammates can.

		<p>The arm brace is something that is used for players to recover, and not traditionally used while actually playing. Not only does this brace help get players back faster, but it also decreases the risk of tearing the ligament again. 

		<p>There have been hundreds of cases of repeat Tommy John Surgeries making it a common occurrence to have the procedure done multiple times. Getting the actual UCL surgery means that pitchers are sidlined for at least a year, but position players have the opportunity to come back sooner to primarly help as a hitter. </p>

			<h3>Old School or New School?</h3>
			<p>With how new the internal brace is, most players getting the new surgery are high schoolers, college athletes, and adolescents. Since it is so easy to get the surgery, many players might still be hesitant to try the brace due to how knew it is. Also, the upsides of getting the normal Tommy John Surgeries include a whole new ligament which many players have said makes them stronger. 

			<p> "It's really alarming to see how many kids and their parents want to get Tommy John so they come back better than before," Rivera noted.

			<p>However, because these kids only have so much time before trying to make it to the big leagues, there is a need to get them back quicker than MLB players who have already established a spot in the pros. Because of this, the brace is a perfect alternative to help get these players back quicker and the data shows that recovery times are dropping significantly over the past few years. 

			<p>Between 2016 and 2022 the average recovery time for high school players dropped from 33 months to just 15. It is not just high schoolers though; college and minor league players have also seen a decline in recover time. 

			<p>In an article, The Athletic mentioned how the internal brace is mostly used by amateur players, so data on how many of these players getting the new procedure is hard to find. However, it is not hard to conclude that a dramatic decrease from 33 months to 15 must be a result of new medical breakthroughs. 

			<p>The Athletic also mentioned how after this brace surgery, players should be able to return to throwing in 6 months, and depending how that goes, they can be back playing in less than a year after the procedure. Because the internal brace is so new, it will take time to really see how the surgery affects the rate of Tommy John cases in the future.

			<p>As for now, the data suggests that recovery times are already on the decline especially for amateur ball players. Major League players often use the minor leagues as well as other amateur leagues as a way of testing new additions to the game. One could speculate that the internal brace will eventually be the main method for treating Tommy John if players at lower levels are experiencing positive effects.
